But, as far as I’m aware, I got closer to perfection than anyone before me:<ul><li>The video plays at 20 fps, the highest frame rate possible in Minecraft.<li>The image resolution is <eq><math><mrow><mn>512</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>384</mn></mrow></math></eq>, just like the original animation.<li>It’s grayscale, not just black-and-white.<li>On modern CPUs and GPUs, you can join a world and see the demo play at 20 fps exactly. I didn’t speed up the video after recording.

So before diving in, let’s scratch out some incredibly easy, almost cheaty ways to run Bad Apple!! in Minecraft:<ol><li>Using mods is not okay. Sodium and other optimization mods can be used for testing on low-end devices, but the video must play in real-time on high-end devies on vanilla.<li>Using command blocks to achieve 20 fps or use <code>/setblock</code> is not okay.<li>Using datapacks, which are basically another way to use commands, is not okay.<li>Using animated textures is not okay.</ol><p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Prior art</span></span>I didn’t want to go into this blind, so I tried to find what others did before me.

The video by catlord5 was an exception, but it rendered <eq><math><mrow><mn>40</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow></math></eq> slower than I’d liked it to. This was hardly a surprise: Minecraft has a very slow game engine (for the dumbest reasons), so I’d need lots of clever optimizations.<p>Not only is Minecraft’s simulation engine terrible, its render engine is terrible too. Sodium optimizes it a bit, but I wanted to make vanilla play the demo in real-time too. Rendering a <eq><math><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>16</mn></mrow></math></eq> chunk is slow independent of its contents, so the fewer chunks the screen spans, the better.<p>20 fps is hard to achieve for another reason. Redstone can’t run faster than 20 ticks per second, so any practically usable clock generators emit 10 Hz signals, which is not enough to get 20 fps. In fact, it’s even worse: redstone dust is, like, the only component that doesn’t introduce tick delays, but <a href=https://empireminecraft.com/threads/a-guide-to-lag-busting-%E2%80%93-the-things-you-can-do.84889/>it’s very laggy</a>, because no one at Mojang seems to know graph algorithms.<p>Oh boy, I’m not going to finish this over a weekend.<h2>How it started</h2><p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Data source</span></span>Ironically, the hardest part of this project was figuring out how to store raw frames in Minecraft.<p>There’s really few popular ways to store data.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Hopper line</span></span>The most popular one is to store items in chests and take them out with hoppers:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="A double chest, connected via a hopper to another double chest, connected via another hopper to the 3rd double chest, connected to the 4th double chest. One of the hoppers is analyzed by a comparator."title="A double chest, connected via a hopper to another double chest, connected via another hopper to the 3rd double chest, connected to the 4th double chest. One of the hoppers is analyzed by a comparator."src=hopper-line.png></div><p>Hoppers take the items out in the same order they are put in. Comparators emit the fullness of the containers they are connected to as a power level. Some items can be disambiguated by their fullness (e.g. a cake weighs <eq><math><mrow><mn>64</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow></math></eq> more than dirt), so this effectively stores a sequence of bits.<p>The problem is that hoppers have a delay of 0.4s between transferring items, reducing the maximum possible frame rate to 2.5 fps. To achieve 5 fps (or 10 fps <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaced_video>interlaced</a>), two hoppers have to be paired concurrently, which is really hard to tile. Honest 10 fps require 4 hoppers, and hoppers are damn slow to simulate. And I wanted 20 fps.<p>This wasn’t going to work.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Packed binary</span></span>If I couldn’t decrease latency, what about increasing throughput?<p>Minecraft has music discs, which, when put into jukeboxes and read out via comparators, emit a number from 1 to 15, depending on the disc. That’s almost 4 bits; with luck, I’ll figure out how to pad it to 4 bits exactly, and then I’ll spread these 4 bits over time, increasing the frame rate from 2.5 fps to 10 fps (if 1 hopper is used) or to 20 fps (if 2 hoppers are used).<p>Shifting bits, however, requires quite a bit of logic, and redstone dust is slow. I made a prototype and, lo and behold, it was in fact slow, as predicted. (I’m smart.)<p>I needed something simpler.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Repeater line</span></span>Let’s dumb it down by borrowing I_Really_Like_Stairs’s idea. It’s the most stupid way of storing data I could think of: just a line of repeaters acting as a delay line, pre-configured to emit the right values at the right moments:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="Two 1x1 repeater lines on top of each other. A repeater line is a line of blocks alternating between sandstone and repeaters. Lines are offset by one block, so that the repeaters of the top line stand on sandstone of the bottom line. The lines end with iron trapdoors."title="Two 1x1 repeater lines on top of each other. A repeater line is a line of blocks alternating between sandstone and repeaters. Lines are offset by one block, so that the repeaters of the top line stand on sandstone of the bottom line. The lines end with iron trapdoors."src=redstone-line.png></div><p>This enables tileable 1x1 pixels. Unfortunately, it seems to be <em>really</em> slow: I_Really_Like_Stairs’s video had <eq><math><mrow><mn>650</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow></math></eq> smaller resolution than my target, contained only the first 150 frames, and had to be sped up <eq><math><mrow><mn>20</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow></math></eq> anyway. So even this very simple solution was not going to cut it.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Structures</span></span>Okay, I give up. Is there something that isn’t quite redstone, but is still considered more or less vanilla?<p>Hmm, there’s something called <a href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Structure_Block>structure blocks</a>. They aren’t obtainable in survival, but they aren’t nearly as overpowered as command blocks. They act like Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V of sorts: a structure block put into <code>SAVE</code> mode can store a region of blocks to memory to a named location, and a <code>LOAD</code> structure block can load it to another place. Structure blocks can be activated by redstone, so it’s as simple as connecting a structure block to a clock, right?<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Disclaimer</span></span>You might think this is cheating. It’s not “real” redstone, so it doesn’t count. But I think that’s an ignorant point of view.<p>We like redstone because it lets us build complicated mechanisms, like computers, from simple and limited components. We dislike commands because they reduce large redstone builds to just one command, almost laughing at redstone builders.<p>In my opinion, <strong>structstone</strong> is much closer to redstone than commands. Whatever we’re going to achieve is not going to be easy in the slightest. It’s not as simple as “put blocks at the right places”. In fact, we haven’t even started. There’s going to be <em>a lot</em> of reverse-engineering, techniques borrowed from video codecs, and other clever solutions down below. Some of the problems pushed me to the limit, and perfecting the solutions required collaboration with other people.<p>If this is your hard boundary, I’m sorry. If it isn’t, keep reading – I promise I won’t disappoint you.<h2>How it’s going</h2><p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Animation</span></span>Structure blocks are easy to use. You place some blocks you wish to save and a structure block nearby, configuring it to <code>SAVE</code> the region to a named location. You then activate the block. To load the region, you place another structure block, configure it to <code>LOAD</code>, and then activate it with a redstone signal (a button in the screenshot below):<p><div class=diagram><img alt='Three structure blocks in a row. The first one is configured to save the block above it (red wool) to a location called "red". The next one saved a yellow wool block to "yellow". The third one is configured to load a block from "red" above it. There&#39s no block there yet, but a redstone line with a button is connected to the structure block; when pressed, the button would trigger the loading.'title='Three structure blocks in a row.

Loading the same structure repeatedly is not going to cut it.<p>Guess what, the area a <code>LOAD</code> structure block loads to can overlap with the structure block itself. So a structure block can replace itself with another structure block, configured to load another structure!<p><div class=diagram><img alt='A structure block saves two blocks above it to "red". The blocks are: 1) a structure block loading from "yellow", overlapping with itself, 2) a red wool block. There&#39s another such construction with "red" and "yellow" swapped nearby.

The third structure block loads from "red" with a button, but isn&#39t activated yet.'src=structure-blocks-red-yellow.png></div><p>In theory, when the “<code>LOAD</code> from red” block is activated, it should load a red wool block, but also replace itself with a “<code>LOAD</code> from yellow” block, so the colors will alternate between activations.<p>In practice, there’s a <em>big</em> lag spike, a <em>yellow</em> wool block is spawned rather than a red one, and the redstone dust keeps being active despite the button being unpressed:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="A yellow wool block appears above the third structure block. The button is unpressed, but the dust is active."title="A yellow wool block appears above the third structure block. The button is unpressed, but the dust is active."src=structure-blocks-red-yellow-activated.png></div><p>Can you guess what the reason is?<p>When the “<code>LOAD</code> from red” block is activated, it puts a red wool block and a structure block. It then sends updates to these blocks. The new structure block receives an update, notices an activated redstone dust line nearby, and activates. It loads a yellow wool block and a structure block. It then sends updates to these blocks. The new structure block receives an update…<p>This recursion ends at an arbitrary point, when Minecraft hits a hard limit, which by luck results in a yellow block being spawned rather than a red one. The limit runs out before Minecraft has time to fully process the dust depowering, so it’s only partly depowered: the power levels along the line turn from <eq><math><mrow><mn>15</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>14</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>13</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>12</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>11</mn></mrow></math></eq> to <eq><math><mrow><mn>7</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>8</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>9</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>10</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>9</mn></mrow></math></eq>, not to <eq><math><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo separator=true>,</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></math></eq> as expected.<p>Theoretically, <a href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Zero-ticking>zero-ticking</a> should prevent this, but I’ve had enough of theory. Let’s just add a delay with a repeater:<p><div class=diagram><img alt='"red" and "yellow" structures, each 3 blocks wide and 2 block tall. The bottom right corners of both structures contain structure blocks loading the other structure over itself.

Both structure blocks are powered by a redstone block (in bottom left) with a repeater inbetween. Both repeaters are OFF.'src=working-structure-blocks-red-yellow.png></div><p>These structures should be built under <code>/tick freeze</code>, so that the repeaters are turned off. This way, when the structure is loaded, there’s a 1 redstone tick delay before replacing the structure:<p><div class=diagram><video alt="The structure from above alternating between red and yellow wool every redstone tick."title="The structure from above alternating between red and yellow wool every redstone tick."autoplay loop muted playsinline src=working-structure-blocks-red-yellow-running.webm></video></div><p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Activation</span></span>This mechanism can be paused by locking the repeater:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="Another repeater points into the repeater in the structure.

The structure immediately replaces the solid block with a repeater, which ignores the dust, so no infinite recursion happens. After the last frame, the structure block can place the solid block back to facilitate restarting.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Ticks</span></span>There’s two kinds of ticks in Minecraft: redstone ticks and game ticks. The game engine recomputes physics at 20 Hz (game ticks), but redstone logic is only recomputed at 10 Hz (redstone ticks). At least, that’s the story they tell you.<p>In reality, all events are processed at <eq><math><mn>0.05</mn></math></eq> s intervals; it’s just that redstone components schedule their updates at multiples of <eq><math><mn>0.1</mn></math></eq> s. So if an event initiated by the user happens at <eq><math><mn>13.20</mn></math></eq> s, redstone has a chance of responding at <eq><math><mn>13.20</mn></math></eq> s, <eq><math><mn>13.30</mn></math></eq> s, <eq><math><mn>13.40</mn></math></eq> s, etc. And if the event happens <eq><math><mn>0.05</mn></math></eq> s later, redstone will respond <eq><math><mn>0.05</mn></math></eq> s later too.<p>So far, we’ve seen colors alternating 10 times per second. For 20 fps, we need 4 structures:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="4 structures, now 2 block deep. The red and yellow structures are just like before, with the far layer being empty.

By default, even air can replace blocks, so these voids let us overlap structures.<p>The red and yellow group forms one 10 Hz clock, while the blue and green structures form another 10 Hz clock. Both clocks place the wool at the same position, so if the structures are activated at the right offset, 4 colors alternate at 20 Hz:<p><div class=diagram><video alt="The two structures overlapped, visibly alternating between green, yellow, blue, and red."title="The two structures overlapped, visibly alternating between green, yellow, blue, and red."autoplay loop muted playsinline src=4-colors.webm></video></div><p>This video was recorded by manually activating the two clocks at different times, so that they run in different phases. To streamline this process, we can use a long-standing bug where pistons pushing redstone blocks take 3 game ticks to extend when activated directly by user input.

The maximum render distance is 32 chunks, so I’ll probably have to play around with FOV…<p>Wait, <em>how many chunks</em>? There’s a reason 32 chunks are the limit on vanilla: few devices can handle that. And unlike survival worlds, all those <eq><math><mrow><mn>32</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>24</mn><mo>=</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>768</mn></mrow></math></eq> chunks will constantly be updated at 20 Hz! That’s just not going to work.<p>Back to the drawing board?<h2>Or the beginning?</h2><p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Goal</span></span>Minecraft renders blocks in <eq><math><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>16</mn></mrow></math></eq> chunks. Whenever any block in the chunk changes, the whole chunk is rerendered. This takes a while, because Mojang has to support a lot of legacy code. So we need to decrease the number of chunks, without sacrificing resolution.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Textures</span></span>That’s as impossible as placing blocks automatically. In other words, it’s possible if we introduce new tools.<p>Minecraft supports custom textures via resource packs (not to be confused with datapacks). We can take several distinct blocks, say 16, and replace their textures. 16 variants means 4 bits, which will correspond to “subpixels” of a block:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="16 blocks of wool of different colors, using default minecraft textures"title="16 blocks of wool of different colors, using default minecraft textures"src=wool-untextured.png></div><p><div class=diagram><img alt='The same blocks of wool, with textures replaced by 2x2 black-and-white pictures with different pattern for each "color"'title='The same blocks of wool, with textures replaced by 2x2 black-and-white pictures with different pattern for each "color"'src=wool-textured.png></div><p>Even better, we can take <eq><math><mrow><msup><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msup><mo>=</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>256</mn></mrow></math></eq> blocks and add two more colors to the pixels. This gets us from black-and-white to grayscale.<p>We’ve just reduced the block resolution <eq><math><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow></math></eq>, to <eq><math><mrow><mn>256</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>192</mn></mrow></math></eq>, losslessly. That gets us down to 192 chunks updated at 20 Hz.<p>This is still a lot, but should be mostly okay. The worst that can happen if there are too many updates is a decreased frame rate, right?<h2>There are nuances</h2><p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Background</span></span>You see, Minecraft’s rendering engine is tuned for the players, not whatever this is, so it prioritizes updates in nearby chunks.<p>There are several threads building chunks concurrently. Whenever a chunk is updated, it’s added to a queue. Threads that don’t have anything better to do take the closest chunk to the player from the queue and start building it.<p>If there are <eq><math><mi>N</mi></math></eq> threads and the <eq><math><mi>N</mi></math></eq> chunks closest to the player are updated so fast that the workers barely have time to process them fully before the chunks are updated again (which happens 20 times per second), <em>nothing</em> but those <eq><math><mi>N</mi></math></eq> chunks will ever get rendered.<p>You can partially observe this effect here:<p><div class=diagram><video alt="Five towers from before, recorded while standing at the bottom. The red-yellow tower glitches occasionally, rendering as partially red and and partially yellow at times."title="Five towers from before, recorded while standing at the bottom. The red-yellow tower glitches occasionally, rendering as partially red and and partially yellow at times."autoplay loop muted playsinline src=towers-glitch.webm></video></div><p>The towers clearly glitch at the middle occasionally. That’s because they span 3 chunks vertically, so sometimes just two of the chunks are rendered in time.<p>We got lucky here: the render threads eventually catch up with the updates. But in the actual demo, I needed to make sure that there is generally enough free time in each tick for the render threads to catch up with older updates.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Optimization</span></span>According to <a href=https://spark.lucko.me/>Spark</a>, the bottleneck in my demo was just updates in general. It wasn’t even redstone or light updates, it was just <code>setBlock</code> and event handlers being way too slow. So they only way forward was to reduce the number of updates.<p>The simplest way to do that is a variant of delta coding. The idea’s simple: most frames differ very little, so only the blocks that differ should be updated. Theoretically, this should increase performance on most of the scenes.<p>This sounded like a solid plan to me, so I started prototyping.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Prototype</span></span>A structure block can only load <eq><math><mrow><mn>48</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>48</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>48</mn></mrow></math></eq> blocks at once, so I had to tile <eq><math><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></math></eq> smaller <eq><math><mrow><mn>48</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>48</mn></mrow></math></eq> screens.<p>Instead of preparing the data by hand, I generated <a href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Structure_file>structure files</a> with a script. It was just a question of extracting the frames from a video with <code>ffmpeg</code>, loading them into Python with <code>Pillow</code>, and generating an <a href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/NBT_format>NBT</a> file with <a href=https://pypi.org/project/nbtlib/>nbtlib</a>.<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have any screenshots from those times. The code was quite slow (about 7 minutes per run), the result was hard to launch (<code>/tick freeze</code>, press 24 buttons, <code>/tick unfreeze</code>), but it worked.<p>One problem: it was too damn slow, even with delta coding. I knew my PC was old, but I doubted throwing more hardware at it would help sufficiently.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Brainstorming</span></span>Fitting more pixels in a block was not an option: <eq><math><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></math></eq> would require <eq><math><mrow><msup><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn></msup><mo>=</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>262144</mn></mrow></math></eq> blocks, and there simply aren’t that many blocks in Minecraft. I could reduce color resolution to black-and-white, but that wouldn’t be cool. What did I have left?<p>That’s when I found an intriguing note in <a href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Model>the wiki page for models</a>. Models specify shapes of blocks: while most blocks are just cubes, some aren’t, like composters or stairs. Shapes are composed of cuboids specified by XYZ coordinates of two corners, with <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> indicating the front bottom left corner of the cube, and <code>(16, 16, 16)</code> indicating the back top right corner. However, according to the page, the coordinates of the cuboids were allowed to be in range <eq><math><mrow><mo form=prefix stretchy=false>[</mo><mo form=prefix stretchy=false>−</mo><mn>16</mn><mo separator=true>;</mo><mn>32</mn><mo form=postfix stretchy=false>]</mo></mrow></math></eq>, 3 times wider than the block itself.<p>So with the right configuration, a block can render as if it was up to <eq><math><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow></math></eq> bigger than it should be. I could use this to replace 9 blocks with just one block… at least in some common cases, like a totally black or a totally white <eq><math><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow></math></eq> pixels large square, because there weren’t nearly enough blocks for all possible combinations. According to my computations, there were about <eq><math><mn>600</mn></math></eq> usable blocks in Minecraft, so I had <eq><math><mrow><mn>600</mn><mo>−</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>256</mn><mo>=</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>344</mn></mrow></math></eq> blocks left for this optimization. Or a bit fewer than that, because some of the blocks would be used for decoration.<p>I experimented with some heuristics for the combinations and with different block sizes, eventually settling on the following approach:<blockquote><p>The screen is split by a <eq><math><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></math></eq> block grid, each cell containing 4 blocks (and thus 16 pixels). Each possible <eq><math><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></math></eq> pixel sprite is considered as a candidate to be optimized to a single block. Over the course of the algorithm, ranks of various sprites are computed. By the end of the algorithm, as many sprites as there are blocks (minus <eq><math><mn>256</mn></math></eq> for normal <eq><math><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></math></eq> blocks) are assigned, starting with the greatest ranks.<p>The ranks start with <eq><math><mn>0</mn></math></eq>. For every two consecutive frames, the difference between them is computed, and the ranks for cells that changed between the two frames are incremented (both the old cell and the new cell versions). The value of the increment is equal to the number of changes between the two frames, so a cell changing in a fast scene weighs more than in a slow scene.</blockquote><p>This worked! On Mia’s and kira’s devices, anyway. It lagged on my device, so I experimented with some optimization mods for local testing, eventually settling on just using VulkanMod for rendering. With this client-side optimization in place, the animation didn’t fall behind in the long run anymore, though it was still pretty laggy.<h2>Just a little bit more</h2><p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Goal</span></span>There were still some things I wanted to improve, like bit depth (i.e. the number of colors) and the count of optimized <eq><math><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></math></eq> blocks. Both of these issues hinged on getting access to significantly more than the <eq><math><mn>600</mn></math></eq> built-in blocks.<p>I’ve looked high and low for ways to add custom blocks, but all I’ve found were tricks based on wrapping existing blocks in notoriously laggy item frames. And then…<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Blockstates</span></span>I looked at Minecraft’s packed assets again and found this in <code>assets/minecraft/blockstates/oak_log.json</code>:<pre><code class=language-json><span class=hljs-punctuation>{</span>

One feature addition I thought would be nice was music.<p>Resource packs can change the music played by discs. The duration of the music disc stays fixed even if the audio is replaced, so I used <em>Relic</em> as the music disc, as it has the closest duration to “Bad Apple!!”. Just for fun, I replaced the name of the disc with a language file (<code>assets/minecraft/lang/en_us.json</code>), so that the in-game subtitles say “Now Playing: Bad Apple!!” when the disc is played:<pre><code class=language-json><span class=hljs-punctuation>{</span>

An oak button powers the dropper through redstone dust."src=jukebox.png></div><p>The dropper contains one music disc. When the button is pressed, the dropper is activated and transfers the disc to the hopper. The hopper then moves the disc to the jukebox, starting playback. When the jukebox stops playing the disc, the hoppers come unlocked and the disc is transferred to the dropper by the bottom right hopper, ready to be inserted again.<p>There were some troubles with quasiconnectivity: the jukebox emits a redstone signal while playing music, so the hoppers are powered, which in turn powers the dropper by QC. When the music ends, the dropper is not updated and is still powered, so the next button press doesn’t start the music again.<p>The workaround is as follows:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="The same mechanism, powered differently. The dropper is powered by a repeater, directly connected to redstone dust on the receiving end, directly connected to a button."title="The same mechanism, powered differently. The dropper is powered by a repeater, directly connected to redstone dust on the receiving end, directly connected to a button."src=jukebox-qc-workaround.png></div><p>When the button is pressed, the dust is powered, which in turn updates the dropper by QC (because the taxicab distance between the components is <eq><math><mn>2</mn></math></eq>). The dropper realizes it should reset and switches off. One redstone tick later, the repeater powers the dropper again, and the disc is inserted.<p>Any other method of delaying the signal works too, not just with repeaters.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>3… 2… 1…</span></span>For some final UX improvements, it’d’ve been pretty great if the demo could be started without, you know, pressing 25 buttons under <code>/tick freeze</code>.<p>For the viewer to see the whole screen at once, they had to be located far enough from it. I didn’t want the wiring to be visible, and replacing the models for redstone dust and repeaters with empty ones sounded like bad taste to me. In addition, this would inevitably introduce significant delays I wanted to avoid, and hiding instant wire sounded like overengineering, if it even was doable.<p>What I really wanted was basically wireless redstone. Sculk sensors wouldn’t cut it at such a large distance, so I had to find something else. I was about to use <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/n5wshk/new_highspeed_wireless_redstone_device_based_on/>2No2Name’s system</a>…<p>…but then I remembered something I stumbled upon while figuring out how to draw animation with structure blocks. I had a bug where triggering a recursive structure block attempted to perform all the recursive loads within one tick; what if I use that feature benevolently?<p>Yuki helped me figure out a way to make instant wire from structure blocks. This is not an ideal wire, as it only transfers pulses, but it works for my usecase:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="Three components, located far enough from each other that redstone signal can't travel between them.

This torch gets unpowered on the next tick because it’s sitting atop a redstone block, but before that, it activates another structure block. This structure block spawns a powered redstone torch in the third component, triggering the lamp.<p><div class=diagram><video alt="The same three components, showing what happens when the button is pressed"title="The same three components, showing what happens when the button is pressed"autoplay loop muted playsinline src=instant-wire.webm></video></div><p>A structure block spans distances up to <eq><math><mn>48</mn></math></eq> blocks, so this method helped me transfer startup signals between <eq><math><mrow><mn>48</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>48</mn></mrow></math></eq> subscreens.<p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>0… -1… -2…</span></span>It, however, didn’t help transfer the signal from the viewer to behind the screen, as the distance there was about <eq><math><mn>150</mn></math></eq> blocks. Using torches was great because they didn’t need to be reset manually, as the redstone block disabled them in the next tick, getting ready for the next pulse. In this case, though, I had to add reset facilities to the mechanism myself.<p>The idea was simple. When a button is activated, a structure block should spawn another structure block sitting atop a redstone block. That structure block will activate immediately, and should replace itself and the redstone block with air and spawn another structure block + redstone block construct elsewhere. Repeat until the receiver is reached.<p>In practice, this can’t be built in creative because placing a structure block and a redstone block next to each other activates the structure block immediately, without giving enough time to save the construct in the deactivated state. (I did manage to workaround this once, but at this point I can’t reproduce it.) Luckily, I had a Python library for generating structure files from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun's_tenth_rule>LISPy code</a>, so getting the instant wire working was as simple as writing it out by hand in a simple format:<pre><code class=language-python><span class=hljs-comment># ...</span>

High-quality dither algorithms are complex beasts, and the results they produce, although great, depend heavily on the original image. For animation, this means that two consecutive frames, although “close” to a human eye, may produce radically different dithered outputs. This is troublesome for two reasons:<ul><li>A human eye can notice this mess easily.<li>This leads to a lot of updates, especially in fast-paced scenes, more than Minecraft can reasonably handle.</ul><p>Luckily, “local” dither algorithms exist, e.g. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering>Bayer dithering</a>:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="A girl and the sun, with a radial gradient around the sun. The gradient is of average quality, but not chunky anymore."title="A girl and the sun, with a radial gradient around the sun. The gradient is of average quality, but not chunky anymore."src=grayscale-sun-bayer.png></div><p>Subjectively, however, their results are of worse quality than global algorithms, not removing banding completely. Luckily, there’s a middle ground <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering#Void_and_cluster>solution</a> based on blue noise. In one sentence, a grayscale noise of a certain kind is added to the pixels of the picture pointwise, and the pixels are then rounded to nearest representable colors. The two pictures above, demonstrating non-Bayerian dithering, were produced with this method by GIMP.<p>Unfortunately, <code>ffmpeg</code>, the tool I used to generate video, doesn’t support blue noise dithering, so I had to take a texture from <a href=https://momentsingraphics.de/BlueNoise.html>Christoph Peters’s blog</a>, crop it to <eq><math><mrow><mn>512</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>384</mn></mrow></math></eq>, and apply dithering manually with a script in Rust. (I didn’t want to wait for Python to produce the result in half an hour, only for me to realize I made an off-by-one error.) The result was a little bit worse than the two examples above, because I had to choose one palette for all frames, but good enough nonetheless:<p><div class=diagram><img alt="A girl swiping a sword, with teh sword leaving a gradient trace.

Just drop every third frame. Except there’s a reason we don’t just drop every third pixel on image resizing, and this reason applies to the time axis too.<p>Suppose there’s an object moving monotonically in one direction over the course of several frames. Prior to downsampling, the object travels the same distance between consecutive frames. After downsampling, the object travels twice as more in odd frames than in even ones.<p>This is jarring to the human eye! In addition, this means that odd frames usually contain twice as many changes as odd frames, resulting in a saw-like pattern in the MSPT (milliseconds per tick) plot.<p>Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to find a better solution. Although there are many 60 fps videos of “Bad Apple!!” in the internet, all these videos were upscaled with a tool or AI. Neither stood a chance against fast-paced scene changes, producing to tons of artifacts.<h2>So long, and thanks for all the fish</h2><p class=next-group><span aria-level=3 class=side-header role=heading><span>Retrospective</span></span>And… that’s it? Looking back, the result looks almost trivial to achieve, which raises the question why no one’s done it before.<p>It sure was a winding path, with many dead ends I didn’t mention. I started with a <eq><math><mrow><mn>48</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>36</mn></mrow></math></eq> screen and 2 colors, got to <eq><math><mrow><mn>128</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>96</mn></mrow></math></eq> and 10 colors and then increased the resolution to <eq><math><mrow><mn>256</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>192</mn></mrow></math></eq>, and finally had to reduce the number of colors to 6 to get the resolution to <eq><math><mrow><mn>512</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>384</mn></mrow></math></eq>. I’ve tried to play the music with note blocks, only to realize that achieving good quality might as well be a totally separate project. I invented structstone and started prototyping a full-blown computer based on this technique.<p>I played around with <code>ffmpeg</code>, switched to <code>mpv</code> as my go-to media player, and finally got around to trying out <a href=https://lib.rs/image>the image crate</a>. I wrote code during SSRI-induced sleepless nights. I thought of this as a hackaton, sacrificing code quality for faster response time, carefully balancing the two, only to realize I didn’t take <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle>the Pareto principle</a> into account. I read Minecraft’s decompiled code and wrote <a href=../ru/minecraft-compares-arrays-in-cubic-time/>a post</a> on what I’ve found. I used various tricks to minimize the size of the world.<p>This was a fun experience. Even though it took more than a month and I grew tired and a bit resentful, I enjoyed thinking outside of the box and collaborating with friends. It made for a nice change of pace compared to my typical projects. Honestly, I think every developer should try to build something like this for a while.
